said although I consider HalfLife as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today

of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release HalfLife revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D Doom and Quake This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay fun puzzles mechanics a narrativedriven singleplayer experience with fastpaced multiplayer action

        "review": "Whats the first thing that comes to mind when reviewing a video game Well for me it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations And with this little gem called HalfLife it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering There is more heart creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valves greatest achievement With over 50 game awards its a strong justification HalfLife isnt just one of the greatest FPS games of all time HalfLife isnt literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam HalfLife is quite simply one of the greatest games ever made When compared to certain FPS games in the past and todays time which both heavily rely on longwinded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game HalfLife annihilates this often compulsed aspect by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the firstperson viewpoint leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability For summarization You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times The game is a perpetual maze leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead Most of the time the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases Although HalfLife has shortlived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one the game has no levels But to make up for this traditional concept the game is split into a number of mindboggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability To start off with this games story youre none other than Gordon Freeman A young man who holds a PhD in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico Arriving late for work yet again you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breathtaking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word Incredible Its as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position almost reminiscent of watching an actionpacked movie along with the credits of the producers names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen As you make your first step in the heavily secured facility youre constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit or the HEV suit for short While all things are hunkydory those things soon turn to the worst very soon After a failed experiment involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an AntiMass Spectrometer the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous Black Mesa Incident And with this alien lifeforms from the dimension of Xen are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility along with the Army that storm the place after the gone haywired facilitys emergency call has been echoed This of course doesnt make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military While there isnt exactly much to complain about I would admit that guiding the chickenedout scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming as well as the alien lifeform Vortigaunt from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you as you are not capable of doing that yourself You do start off with a crowbar right As well as Im probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors But then again this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show so thats an added bonus to the magnitude of the game For the long run Ive had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game If you havent play HalfLife or even worse not familiar with HalfLife its still a big compulsory recommendation from me",

add the Change Game option to the main menu which lets you select and play newly installed HalfLife mods without first having to restart Steam in order for them to be listed in your Steam library Not only is this more convenient but time spent playing mods that are selected via this menu will also count toward your total hours played for HalfLife and keep all of your HalfLife screenshots in one place Cool right HalfLife released in November of 1998 is no doubt one of the most influential firstperson shooters of all time and Im no doubt the billionth person to tell you that HalfLife runs on the Gold Source engine which is a fork of id Softwares Quake 1 idtech 2 engine HalfLifes engine is a big part of what makes it so good in my opinion In large part because the movement just feels fantastic Unlike in HalfLife 2 which also has great movement though the Shift key doesnt make you sprint but walk Sprintrun is always on by default you never tire and you move at a rather brisk pace You move about as quickly as you do in other firstperson shooters of the mid to late 90s but dont let that fool you into thinking that HalfLife plays like a trve oldskool FPS What Im saying is not that HalfLife isnt oldschool but that its release marked a shift in the way that firstperson shooters would come to be developed for better or for worse HalfLife plays very differently in many ways to the firstperson shooters that preceeded it While there is no 2 3 or even 4weapon carrylimit as you often see in many modern firstperson shooters and you can carry all of the games weapons on your person at the same time and as already mentioned movement is rather fast etc etc you are however dealing with combat that is very coverfocused as the games most threatening foes rely heavily on hitscanning attacks There is nothing inherently unoldschool about hitscanning enemies its just that they make up the majority of HalfLifes tougher combat encounters and youre never really going to be circlestrafing and dodging incoming projectiles like you would expect to do in firstperson shooters preceeding HalfLife that are also touted as oldschool FPS classics Uuhhh you will be dodging smg nades though or at least be trying to trust me HalfLife also doesnt have secrets in the oldschool FPS sense and the games maps arent all disparate or somewhat disparate levels but flow together more seamlessly into large chapters with a pacing that is more varied than what youd see in many other firstperson shooters from this era HalfLife is not oldschool in the same sense that for example Doom or Quake are Uhm I guess Blood kind of did the wholeANYWAY while HalfLife was by no means the first FPS to include NPCs or scripted set pieces it is arguably the FPS most responsible for leading the genre in a more scripted linear and storyfocused direction which in the HalfLife series case culminated with HalfLife 2 Episode 2 in 2007 This is one of the main ways in which HalfLife would go on to influence the genre which Im not saying is all a bad thing who knows if we would have had Bioshock if it werent for HalfLife What I know for certain is that HalfLifes got mods Ah the mods There is no shortage of fantastic HalfLife mods Ive heard that there was a little mod that could called CounterStrike which went on to become one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time More on the movement Letting go of the forward key and holding down either the right or left directional key while smoothly moving your mouse in the same direction will allow you to curve your forward midair trajectory either left or right this is called air strafing You may freely alternate between left and righthand air strafes but this can be a little tricky at first Interestingly air strafing also increases your forward momentum and you can garner immense speed by chaining together welltimed jumps and air strafes bunny hopping Air strafing is a movement quirk carried over from Quakes adorable and quirky game engine where it works differently in several ways but the main gist of it is the same there as it is in HalfLife hold directional key move mouse in the same direction gaming bliss ensues This movement goodness was subsequently carried over into the Source Engine and tons of other games While the ways in which different games with air strafing handle momentum acceleration varies the aforementioned main gist of it all remains intact til this day and can even be seen in more recent games like Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends The bhop KZ climb and surf movement communities were born out of HalfLife and GoldSrc idtech 2 laid the groundwork for these things and with GoldSrc and HalfLife they came to fruition thanks to passionate communities Shoutout to Momentum Mod Theres A LOT more to HalfLifes movement than that but I have to stop myself before I write an entire speedrunning tutorial or I go off about how amazing Team Fortress 2s rocket jumping mechanics are Basically movement in HalfLifes engine and its derivative Source is tight deep and satisfying Like your mum I may be sooomewhat biased by the fact that HalfLife is literally one of the first games I ever played and nostalgia is crack cocaine even if my only experience with HalfLife in my diaperwearing years was with HalfLife Uplink which is effectively the games demo sort of and also well worth playing by the way but to me HalfLife oozes charm Its a cozy game The believable but blocky enviroments the heavily exaggerated reverberation effects the ARGH NO STOP of the scientists the kapow of the shotgun it all makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside In HalfLife you play as 27year old theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman who works at the Black Mesa Research Facility located somewhere in the New Mexico desert The game opens with you arriving late for work in the now very iconic tram ride intro sequence as Kelly Baileys fantastically ominous ambient music plays in the background As you breathe the air and take in the games atmosphere laden with hitech industrial theming it becomes abundantly clear that the goingson at Black Mesa must be of unfathomable magnitude and utmost importance The intro sets the tone for the game INCREDIBLY well I cannot say enough positive things about this intro Its a little long yes but its communicative and just wow When you start the game from the moment the games title on a black background fades away and allows you to see and until the games end you experience the game world entirely through the eyes of Gordon Freeman From the moment the proverbial and literal ride begins youre there every step of the way with Gordon through thick and thin through the scorching desert through once sterile offices where now lie the decaying corpses of your former colleagues through test labs home to questionable ethics its all unraveled to the player from Gordons perspective and its so damn compelling",

        "review": "The original HalfLife is an FPS masterpiece which kickstarted a narrative and mechanical revolution thats still ongoing in the genre to this day Because of its understated minimalist plot using environmental and gameplaybased storytelling its aged incredibly well and still makes for a very engaging experience The gameplay is every bit as excellent and solid as it was all those years ago the sound design is still phenomenal and the stylizedyetrealistic art direction makes for a look that still holds up today Buying it also gives you access to a huge huge quantity of great quality mods developed for the game over the course of almost 20 years and thats definitely worth the price of admission But looking beyond its legacy in modding and the standard also set by later entries in the series HalfLife is still a remarkable game and an absolute musthave",

mere mention of its name is enough to give you chills Many consider it the greatest FPS of all time Valves founding FPS is such a masterpiece that we still feel its aura today Named Game of the Year by more than 50 magazines it is a cult title It even made the terms DoomLike and QuakeLike obsolete Without forgetting that this is the beginning of Valves success story Is it even possible to do a purely objective review for HalfLife bTheyre waiting for you Gordon In the test chamberb Gordon Freeman is a scientist with a degree in theoretical physics from MIT specializing in the research of Anomalous Materials He is employed at the prestigious Black Mesa scientific complex Freeman is is entrusted with an experiment of capital importance the analysis of a crystal of alien origin Unfortunately contact of the sample with the antimass spectrometer has Unforeseen Consequences This leads to a Resonance Cascade of phenomenal power partially destroying the research center Worse still it opened an interdimensional breach through which warlike aliens emerge The army was called to the rescue but was ordered to kill all the witnesses Gordon must then fight his way to save his colleagues and escape this hell bYou arent scared are youb One of the great strengths of HalfLife is its storytelling You play as Gordon Freeman and see everything through his eyes No cutscene or dialogue intersperses the scientists adventures Everything is done so that you identify as best as possible with the character a hero in spite of himself bRun Think Shoot Liveb HalfLife is the ultimate evolution of the 90s FPS Its no longer just a question of taking down enemies Puzzles push you to interact with the world to progress use levers valves push or pull crates etc There are even vehicle sequences with a tram On a Rail The gunfights are breathtaking the AI is very clever bOh my Godwere doomedb Black Mesa is invaded by all kinds of creatures from Xen The soldiers shoots on sight at everything that moves the aliens as well as the employees of the Research Center The HalfLife bestiary is rich and varied each of the NPCs or creatures allies and enemies alike has its own behavior and animations The scientists and the security guards are your friends and colleagues they only want the best for you In addition to giving you advices they open certain locked doors The scientists can heal you if youre wounded and the Barneys can easily kill aliens like Headcrabs or Vortigaunts The Xen creatures are very different from each other but they all have one thing in common Theyre after you Here is the list of all these alien monsters Headcrabs Zombies Vortigaunts Houndeyes Barnacles Bullsquid Tentacles Gargantuas Ichthyosaurs Alien Grunts Alien Controllers The HECU has been dispatched to the Research Center to stem the alien invasion and do everything to prevent the Black Mesa disaster from becoming known These soldiers are battlehardened intelligent and brutal They

women we fight An Assassin is as agile as a Kunoichi dressed all in black They are as fast as lightning and can perform spectacular jumps Theyre equipped with a silent Glock and a huge and magnificent pair of grenades attached to the belt bWelcome to the HEV Mark IV protective system for use in hazardous environment conditionsb The HEV Mark IV protective system is the orange suit worn by Gordon Freeman It is the main equipment of the series it bears the symbol Gordon Freeman resists radioactivity burns electricity and chemicals thanks to it It absorbs a large part of the damage received and can be recharged using HEV chargers or batteries The Long Jump Module allows Gordon to make great leaps forward which proves very useful later bGordon doesnt need to hear all this Hes a highly trained professionalb Despite his appearance as a simple scientist Gordon Freeman handles weapons to perfection thanks to the time he spent in the Hazard Course The weapons are very numerous and varied classic or experimental and even a few of alien origin Heres the full list of weapons Crowbar Pistol Shotgun SMG or AR Revolver Crossbow Rocket Launcher Grenade Tripmine C4 Snark Hivehand Gauss Gun Gluon Gun bThose new suits can be tricky Please proceed to the next areab Hazard Course is Black Mesas training space for HEV suit users This is the one and only tutorial present in HalfLife made to familiarize yourself with the games mechanics bHey did you hear somethingb The music and sounds in HalfLife are of high quality They were composed by Kelly Bailey Each important moment in the game has its own music sometimes gloomy sometimes epic Hazardous Environments the Valve Theme which gives you chills during the fight on the edge of the cliff in Surface Tension All human characters are voiced and each monster has its own sounds Its easy to know which enemy to face next without even seeing it Every sound accentuate the science fiction touch and the players immersion The voice of the HEV Suit gives valuable information on the environment health status or quantity of ammunition bYou sure were going the right wayb The graphics of HalfLife are sumptuous for its time thanks to the GoldSrc engine The game became more beautiful and detailed when it was rereleased on Steam The settings are particularly immersive and varied bDidnt want to die alone anywayb In addition to its extraordinary singleplayer campaign HalfLife has a classic multiplayer deathmatch mode The fights are fun dynamic and brutal thanks to the large quantity weapons available to players In addition to that theres a plethoric choice of 18 maps and theyre different enough to renew the gaming experience bCatch me later Ill buy you a beerb 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of HalfLife which Valve celebrated with a contentrich update First of all the main menu of the game has been replaced by that of the WON version it is the original menu from 1998 The original Valve intro is also restored It finally brings

hitscanning attacks There is nothing inherently unoldschool about hitscanning enemies its just that they make up the majority of HalfLifes tougher combat encounters and youre never really going to be circlestrafing and dodging incoming projectiles like you would expect to do in firstperson shooters preceeding HalfLife that are also touted as oldschool FPS classics Uuhhh you will be dodging smg nades though or at least be trying to trust me HalfLife also doesnt have secrets in the oldschool FPS sense and the games maps arent all disparate or somewhat disparate levels but flow together more seamlessly into large chapters with a pacing that is more varied than what youd see in many other firstperson shooters from this era HalfLife is not oldschool in the same sense that for example Doom or Quake are Uhm I guess Blood kind of did the wholeANYWAY while HalfLife was by no means the first FPS to include NPCs or scripted set pieces it is arguably the FPS most responsible for leading the genre in a more scripted linear and storyfocused direction which in the HalfLife series case culminated with HalfLife 2 Episode 2 in 2007 This is one of the main ways in which HalfLife would go on to influence the genre which Im not saying is all a bad thing who knows if we would have had Bioshock if it werent for HalfLife What I know for certain is that HalfLifes got mods Ah the mods There is no shortage of fantastic HalfLife mods Ive heard that there was a little mod that could called CounterStrike which went on to become one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time More on the movement Letting go of the forward key and holding down either the right or left directional key while smoothly moving your mouse in the same direction will allow you to curve your forward midair trajectory either left or right this is called air strafing You may freely alternate between left and righthand air strafes but this can be a little tricky at first Interestingly air strafing also increases your forward momentum and you can garner immense speed by chaining together welltimed jumps and air strafes bunny hopping Air strafing is a movement quirk carried over from Quakes adorable and quirky game engine where it works differently in several ways but the main gist of it is the same there as it is in HalfLife hold directional key move mouse in the same direction gaming bliss ensues This movement goodness was subsequently carried over into the Source Engine and tons of other games While the ways in which different games with air strafing handle momentum acceleration varies the aforementioned main gist of it all remains intact til this day and can even be seen in more recent games like Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends The bhop KZ climb and surf movement communities were born out of HalfLife and GoldSrc idtech 2 laid the groundwork for these things and with GoldSrc and HalfLife they came to fruition thanks to passionate communities Shoutout to Momentum Mod Theres A LOT more to HalfLifes movement than that but I have to stop myself before I write an entire speedrunning tutorial or I go off about how amazing Team Fortress 2s rocket jumping mechanics are Basically movement in HalfLifes engine and its derivative Source is tight deep and satisfying Like your mum I may be sooomewhat biased by the fact that HalfLife is literally one of the first games I ever played and nostalgia is crack cocaine even if my only experience with HalfLife in my diaperwearing years was with HalfLife Uplink which is effectively the games demo sort of and also well worth playing by the way but to me HalfLife oozes charm Its a cozy game The believable but blocky enviroments the heavily exaggerated reverberation effects the ARGH NO STOP of the scientists the kapow of the shotgun it all makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside In HalfLife you play as 27year old theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman who works at the Black Mesa Research Facility located somewhere in the New Mexico desert The game opens with you arriving late for work in the now very iconic tram ride intro sequence as Kelly Baileys fantastically ominous ambient music plays in the background As you breathe the air and take in the games atmosphere laden with hitech industrial theming it becomes abundantly clear that the goingson at Black Mesa must be of unfathomable magnitude and utmost importance The intro sets the tone for the game INCREDIBLY well I cannot say enough positive things about this intro Its a little long yes but its communicative and just wow When you start the game from the moment the games title on a black background fades away and allows you to see and until the games end you experience the game world entirely through the eyes of Gordon Freeman From the moment the proverbial and literal ride begins youre there every step of the way with Gordon through thick and thin through the scorching desert through once sterile offices where now lie the decaying corpses of your former colleagues through test labs home to questionable ethics its all unraveled to the player from Gordons perspective and its so damn compelling",

mere mention of its name is enough to give you chills Many consider it the greatest FPS of all time Valves founding FPS is such a masterpiece that we still feel its aura today Named Game of the Year by more than 50 magazines it is a cult title It even made the terms DoomLike and QuakeLike obsolete Without forgetting that this is the beginning of Valves success story Is it even possible to do a purely objective review for HalfLife bTheyre waiting for you Gordon In the test chamberb Gordon Freeman is a scientist with a degree in theoretical physics from MIT specializing in the research of Anomalous Materials He is employed at the prestigious Black Mesa scientific complex Freeman is is entrusted with an experiment of capital importance the analysis of a crystal of alien origin Unfortunately contact of the sample with the antimass spectrometer has Unforeseen Consequences This leads to a Resonance Cascade of phenomenal power partially destroying the research center Worse still it opened an interdimensional breach through which warlike aliens emerge The army was called to the rescue but was ordered to kill all the witnesses Gordon must then fight his way to save his colleagues and escape this hell bYou arent scared are youb One of the great strengths of HalfLife is its storytelling You play as Gordon Freeman and see everything through his eyes No cutscene or dialogue intersperses the scientists adventures Everything is done so that you identify as best as possible with the character a hero in spite of himself bRun Think Shoot Liveb HalfLife is the ultimate evolution of the 90s FPS Its no longer just a question of taking down enemies Puzzles push you to interact with the world to progress use levers valves push or pull crates etc There are even vehicle sequences with a tram On a Rail The gunfights are breathtaking the AI is very clever bOh my Godwere doomedb Black Mesa is invaded by all kinds of creatures from Xen The soldiers shoots on sight at everything that moves the aliens as well as the employees of the Research Center The HalfLife bestiary is rich and varied each of the NPCs or creatures allies and enemies alike has its own behavior and animations The scientists and the security guards are your friends and colleagues they only want the best for you In addition to giving you advices they open certain locked doors The scientists can heal you if youre wounded and the Barneys can easily kill aliens like Headcrabs or Vortigaunts The Xen creatures are very different from each other but they all have one thing in common

pair of grenades attached to the belt bWelcome to the HEV Mark IV protective system for use in hazardous environment conditionsb The HEV Mark IV protective system is the orange suit worn by Gordon Freeman It is the main equipment of the series it bears the symbol Gordon Freeman resists radioactivity burns electricity and chemicals thanks to it It absorbs a large part of the damage received and can be recharged using HEV chargers or batteries The Long Jump Module allows Gordon to make great leaps forward which proves very useful later bGordon doesnt need to hear all this Hes a highly trained professionalb Despite his appearance as a simple scientist Gordon Freeman handles weapons to perfection thanks to the time he spent in the Hazard Course The weapons are very numerous and varied classic or experimental and even a few of alien origin Heres the full list of weapons Crowbar Pistol Shotgun SMG or AR Revolver Crossbow Rocket Launcher Grenade Tripmine C4 Snark Hivehand Gauss Gun Gluon Gun bThose new suits can be tricky Please proceed to the next areab Hazard Course is Black Mesas training space for HEV suit users This is the one and only tutorial present in HalfLife made to familiarize yourself with the games mechanics bHey did you hear somethingb The music and sounds in HalfLife are of high quality They were composed by Kelly Bailey Each important moment in the game has its own music sometimes gloomy sometimes epic Hazardous Environments the Valve Theme which gives you chills during the fight on the edge of the cliff in Surface Tension All human characters are voiced and each monster has its own sounds Its easy to know which enemy to face next without even seeing it Every sound accentuate the science fiction touch and the players immersion The voice of the HEV Suit gives valuable information on the environment health status or quantity of ammunition bYou sure were going the right wayb The graphics of HalfLife are sumptuous for its time thanks to the GoldSrc

        "review": "Half lifeThe game that started it allEven though it was made back in 1998it is still a gemI dont vote games by their graphicsbut by their gameplayThis was an immersingwonderful and addicting experience for meI lived another lifeIn this gameThe game has everything a gamer asks for Immersing GameplayIndulging storyA Nice Selection of Weaponsand graphics that were thrilling in the year it was madebut are all old nowEven now this title holds up till todayshining its glory as the first game that Valve ever madeand a game that changed Gaming itselfNow I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game WARNING A little bit of spoiling ahead Gameplay ExcellentEither you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just dont seem to put you in peaceThere were a few places where it did get a little bit boringbut that was because I couldnt wait until I would experience something newThe terrain in the game is nicely madeeven though it is pretty old due to the date it was madeThe places you travel through are pretty differentyou wont be bored of seeing the same old place over and over againThe game itself is nicely balancedexcept that they could have put less ammo in the gameso you wouldnt always have a gun loaded 910 Story A nice story is told throughout the gameand that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the gameEven though it doesnt have any cutscenesit tells its story just wonderfullyIt keeps you in first person mode all of the timeso it makes you live the character all the way through the storyAll the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logicalas if could happen in real lifeThe characters are well done as wellfor they act as normal people would actThey are as they should bethey speakfighthelp you and do other stuffAnd there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the gamebut I will let you figure that out for yourselfThere arent the same scientists all over and over againbut we cant say this with security guardsThe enemies are widely assorted and wont make you think that they are dumbbut play as they are real and trying to get youNo dull moment will get you in this gameso dont be afraid of experiencing any in this game 1010 Weapons There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this gamebut do not expect too muchThere are the main weapons you would except from a game like thisand maybe a little bit more due to an Monster Invasion going on all around youThe game has its own signature weapon A CrowbarBut that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this gameWhile you progress through the game you will find weaponsbut there arent manyso every weapon you getyou make use ofbecause all of them are uniqueAs I wont spoil much hereI will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcherand a few of alien techologies are found in the game as wellYou will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weaponbecause it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weaponsand the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhereWhen you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gunmeaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot itand you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as wellBut when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce backbut if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spotdepending on which way you movedEven if you dont have any ammoyou get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammoEven though it recharges over timeit doesnt take much of it and it has special abilities 8510 Enemies From the headcrab even to the final bossthe enemies are nicely balancedYou are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tacticsso you know what to use on it and what to doYou probably wont find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you arent well armedOnce you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat themjust keep a look out for themor otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickleI wouldnt say that the enemies are hardYou can use the terrain to your advantage as wellLuckilyone group of your enemies is fighting anotherso you can use that to your advantage as wellif you find the right momentwinkBut I wouldnt rely on such stuffI would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of motherfuckersThere are a few weapons which have unlimited ammoand I feel that is unbalancedDont go prancing around as a pony as wellyou will get your ass kickedThere are flying enemiescrawling enemieswalking enemies and big enemiesThe crawling ones are easyjust keep a look out for them so they dont get the jump on youThe Flying ones need the right weaponslike a zoom in crossbowfor they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly awayThe walking ones are easy enoughjust keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OKBut the big ones need a plana strategy and a assault of weapons 9510 Graphics From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doomthis game is amazingIt now has its own HD modelsso a few things look better when the models are turned ONAny computer will be able to get this game runningso why not jump in it alreadyAnd as this game was made in 1998dont expect modern graphicsBut that couldnt stop you from playing this gamecould itThe terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as wellbut if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is todayAnd the graphics arent that badeverything is quite understandableThey have made the graphics the best way they couldand I dont blame them because I dont vote a game by its graphicsAnd if you cant stand the graphics there is a Source version of the gamemade by Valve as wellThere is a version made by fans as wellbut I wouldnt recommend that because it is modified a bitBut the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half lifeand the best out thereOf coursethat is if you look past the graphicsThere are even little details specified in the originl gamebut they wont be seen so good and will be kind of blurredBut be sure to keep your eyes litfor there are many leversbuttons and things like that throughout the gamethat blend in with the enviroment 8510 Overall look Even though this game is datedit is definently not deadBe sure to pick this game up on a saleor even buy it at its full pricebecause this game is worth every cent you pay for itI loved the gameit really got me pulled in and the story was just stunningI loved every place I came upon to in this gameseeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknownThis game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very endingThis is a great classic and everyone should play itit is an experience not to be missedIt changed gaming as it is nowand was a hit in gaming and it still isA wonderful game FINAL SCORE 910 Reviewed by Ultrix",

quart dheure du jeu Vous allez arriver destination et allez procder des exprimentations dans la chambre de test Malheureusement a va mal tourner crant donc une Resonance Cascade ouvrant un portail entre la Terre et une autre dimension pleine de monstruosits envahissant Black Mesa Votre but sera donc de survivre et de retourner la surface Pour ce scnario Valve sest inspir de films comme Alien ou de livres comme The Mist de Stephen King Autant dire que les amateurs de SFHorreur sont servis Je nen dirai pas plus sur le scnario afin de vous laisser la surprise pour ceux dcouvrant HalfLife Le gameplay est tout simplement excellent Liconique combinaison CEH est un prtexte pour expliquer la rsistance de Gordon son environnement Sans cette tenue Gordon ne ferait pas long feu Mais que vaut un bouclier sans une pe La toute premire arme du jeu qui vous aidera un minimum survivre est symbolique Le pieddebiche la base un outil est devenu licne de la franchise voire mme une vritable icne du jeu vido Dans HalfLife vous aurez souvent besoin dutiliser la bonne arme au bon moment et au bon endroit la diffrence de Doom o on constate surtout une hirarchie entre les armes Le jeu est trs linaire vous ntes pas dans un niveau labyrinthique Le jeu a un chemin trac du dbut la fin Sauf quici cest voulu et bien fait Le bestiaire est vraiment impressionnant Le design global des ennemis est vraiment russi et chacun possde des caractristiques qui nous force changer notre manire de jouer Cela va du crabe de tte o sa mobilit est plus gnante que sa force jusquau Vortigaunt qui lui vous envoie une dcharge invitable Mais les aliens ne sont pas la seule menace Le rythme global du jeu est assez rgulier mme si certains chapitres sont parfois lgrement trop longs La maniabilit est vraiment bonne Sauf concernant les chelles Les musiques sont juste gniales Contrairement beaucoup de jeux HalfLife ne possde pas un thme principal Les musiques contribuent limmersion et forment un tout Cest une russite Mme si lon sent que la qualit des doublages a vieilli les sons sont globalement trs bien travaills dont mme certains devenus iconiques le cri du headcrab qui meurt Le jeu possde un nombre incroyable de mods o vous pourrez trs bien jouer des histoires cres par dautres joueurs Ce jeu est lexemple mme de limportance du modding CounterStrike tait un mod dHalfLife Team Fortress galement Le moteur du jeu tant une grande modification du moteur de Quake II a fait le taf Graphiquement cela na pas tant vieilli que a le jeu a toujours un certain charme visuel HalfLife est un classique Ce jeu marque un tournant dans la faon dont les jeux nous racontent une histoire Il est devenu un modle pour la plupart des FPS sortis par la suite Les FPS modernes sen sont tellement inspir quil est aujourdhui difficile de voir ce quil a de spcial sans recul De la mme manire que le tout premier Super Mario Bros et son level design exemplaire mais transparent aux yeux dun joueur du nouveau millnaire HalfLife a marqu lhistoire du jeu vido comme la fait Doom Cest un jeu incontournable pour tout amateur de FPS Du dbut jusqu la fin pas de cutscenes pas de QTE juste le point de vue de Gordon Freeman avec comme seules divisions de rares chargements Cest ce qui fait la force dHalfLife et cest ce qui le diffrencie autant des autres jeux HalfLife avant mme dtre un gameplay vraiment super est autre chose Ce que vous retiendrez de ce jeu aprs un certain nombre dannes est ce que tout excellent jeu devrait apporter Une exprience PS Ceux nayant pas envie de jouer ce jeu cause de ses graphismes ou autres je vous conseille de vous diriger du ct du jeu Black Mesa le remake dHalfLife Jen ai fait galement une critique",

urlhttpsteamcommunitycomidmiyumiayaserecommended362890tscn1431108183Black Mesa Reviewurl h1NOTE 2h1 I review games to help fellow gamers decide whether they should purchase a game or not With that said although I consider HalfLife as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today Think of it like this everyone enjoys flying modernday commercial jets like the 747 but it doesnt mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the most significant transport aircraft in history h1INTRODUCTIONh1 HalfLife is a narrativedriven linear firstperson shooter FPS action game and is the debut and signature title of Valve Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release HalfLife revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D Doom and Quake This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay fun puzzles mechanics a narrativedriven singleplayer experience with fastpaced multiplayer action The game follows the story of Gordon Freeman a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named Xen Gordon Freeman wearing the HEV Suit must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders Fight against Invading alien monsters and at the same time US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving witnesses of the Black Mesa incident h1LEGACY OF HALFLIFE PROSh1 First FPS game to fully incorporate a NarrativeDriven story as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D Doom mechanic Excellent level designs Realistic combat mechanics may be not as realistic now in 2015 but 17 years ago it was Fun puzzles Great sound effects First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cutscenes Relatively advanced AI back in 1998 with enemies actively dodging tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush Fun fastpaced multiplayer action that set the foundations for CounterStrike which started as a mere mod of HalfLife Mods although HalfLife is not the first video game to be modded it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their HalfLife heritage Challenging difficulty modes but this is a given since most oldschool shooters were challenging h1OLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE CONSh1 Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing Shift as opposed to todays standard which is the reverse No objective tracker players may forget what they were doing especially if they havent played in a while Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey though CSGO players wont have a problem with this h1CONCLUSIONh1 buMASTERPIECEub is the only word that best describes HalfLife in my opinion Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in todays 2015 standard the same can still be considered as part of its charm much like how most of us still enjoy watching oldschool movies and TV shows h1WORTH ITh1 bMUST BUY AND MUST HAVEb I however do recommend you purchase the HalfLife Anthology if you already have HalfLife 2 but if you dont have it get HalfLife Complete h1ADDITIONAL INFO Not necessary for the reviewh1 The advent of HalfLife was a turning point in gaming history most notably the Firstperson shooter genre Before this game the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D Doom and Quake with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the mazelike levels With HalfLife developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative storytelling through leniar levels which is heavily abused by some FPS games today and realistic game mechanics a title which most people agree was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise a thirdperson action game Lets put this in an analogy Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel basically invented the mainstream FPS genre Doom is the HorseDrawn Carriage Doom made FPS games extremely popular accessible and widespread Quake is the Steam Engine Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and plot driven FPS games iCredit Steam User RGX12 for pointing this outi and HalfLife is the Ford Model T Car HalfLife set the standard for modern day FPS games whos basic and essential features still survives today h1Like my Reviews Follow my Curators Pageh1

        "review": "In November 19th 1998 a developer youve never heard of known as Valve released a game on a heavily modified Quake Engine and promptly changed PC gaming as we know it It is revered to this day and played by millions of people Its engine and modding tools revolutionized independent game making as we knew it Counter Strike had its start as a mod for HalfLife The port of Team Fortress known as Team Fortress Classic kept the dream alive and expansion packs like Opposing Forces and Blue Shift let you continue the battle through Black Mesa from a different point of view HalfLife also gave birth to other popular mods as well The Specialist brought John Woo like gun play to a multiplayer stage but also with one guy who always tried to use the Katana Sven Coop was advertised as a way to play HalfLife story mode with friends but ended up with countless community maps anywhere from puzzles to remake maps from other games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill Natural Selection mixed RTS and science fiction horror with competitive multiplayer Brainbread predated the multiplayer zombie craze by a few years And also Frontline Force existed I dont know what it was I only ever heard it was good Also does anyone remember the Dragon Ball Z mod People modded the mod that was rad Oh yeah I should probably talk about the real game Paranoia is good too Half Life was published by Sierra until it wasnt anymore You play as Gordon Freeman the worlds silentist man One day at work Gordon decides to ruin everything by pushing a big rock into a plasma globe This opens up a portal into New Jersey which promptly invades the world with horrible aliens and other baddies Also the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit division of the Marine Corp also show up and theyre also rather disappointed with you So its up to Gordon to hit things with a crowbar shoot things with guns and jump from platform to platform in some sketchy platforming sequences Im not a believer in the idea that video games can age well or not age well I mean I still play games from the 90s on a regular basis and I have fun with them Ive had people tell me the same thing about HalfLife how its just not as good now because newer games have come out But HalfLife not only holds up it actually kind of stomps a good number of recent games into the mud HalfLife mixes slow ambient moments with fast paced Quakelike action expertly Giving you times when youre simply exploring the facility solving simple puzzles and finding hidden areas before throwing you into a allout shit show with either aliens marines or both The amount of diversity in the alien forces is actually kind of amazing Headcrabs zombies bullsquids barnacles Vortigaunt alien grunt and of course who could forget the Chumtoad Theyre not just different enemies with different attacks either each one has their own behavior patterns Headcrabs like to hide in the ceiling and around corners Vortigaunts will flee if they take too much damage Houndeyes will group up together so they can do more damage with their attacks you can actually feed Bullsquids meat on some occasions and I dont speak Headcrab Zombie but I think theyre saying mean things about you The Marines are no slouch either Theyll cover fire flank flush you out with explosives retreat if it gets too hot even cover one anothers retreat Theyre mostly the same as in their basically just another enemy but they mix it up with carrying different weapons The ones carrying the submachine gun will try to keep their distance while the shotgun toting marines have no problems getting in close and turning your insides into outsides Theyll even give you a little kick if you get too close You mix all this together with pretty excellent gun play and you got yourself a good shooter pardner HalfLifes combat is fast and crazy enough to keep you on your toes while cover is a viable option its usually best to just go crazy sprinting and strafing into battle using your assortment of weapons to the fullest Each weapons plays a role especially in later areas of the game and switching from lets say the shotgun to turn someone into mulch before quickly drawing the crossbow to hit someone from a distance isnt only viable but it feels good to pull off Ooh Im getting tingly To me the earliest parts of HalfLife are its strongest Exploring a work place turned alien infestation has a enticing atmosphere like finding a gun on a train track The slow quiet moments which lead into showdowns with the alien invaders are buffered with parts where you find fellow scientists and security guards Then you find your first Marine and the game suddenly goes BOOM KAPOW And youre thrust into a warzone with artillery and very angry men calling you very bad words All of these start to mingle together into one chaotic mess and its amazing Finding security guards holding their own in between aliens and marines brutalizing one another is always a treat especially if they have goodies to give you The game does peter out as it goes on If I had to put a point to it it would probably be when spoiler Gordon gets tossed into the trash compactor spoiler From then on out its basically all action with very little interaction with survivors or puzzle solving Since youre getting further away from the usually populated areas youre less likely to find others that arent actively trying to kill you Exploration also takes a nose dive since youre basically just trying to get across one giant warzone at this point until you reach your destination That being said when you DO run into a Barney or a scientist its more impressive than anything else Oh yeah and the last few stages can leave me alone and stop calling me please HalfLife holds a special place in my heart The collection was the first thing I ever bought for the PC back in 2003 The game itself including all the really well made mods basically meant you only needed to buy that one game Its also the reason why I have a VAC ban on my account Bet you cant guess what I diiiid spoilerIt actually wasnt me spoiler The game is great fun and you can usually get it for a buck or so these days The game is also compressed to hell when you download it so you could get it in likeAn hour if you have dial up Please tell me you dont have dialup HalfLife gets a thumbs up out of a series of thumbs down Cats

        "review": "SO first of all buy this game Secondly if youre using a widescreen monitor 169 etc do yourself a favour and increase the FOV by typing defaultfov any value that doesnt suck into the console unless youre into horse blinders The console can be brought updown by pressing the key or or this or that or tilde or Tilda or Matilda or whatever youll figure it out It may also be wise to eliminate mouse acceleration by enabling raw input in the mouse settings menu To more conveniently play installed mods Step 1 Go here SteamSteamAppscommonHalfLifevalveresource Step 2 Open GameMenures with notepad or something similar you may have to run the game once in order for this file to be generated Step 3 Press ctrl f then search for and delete the line that reads nosteam 1 Doing this will add the Change Game option to the main menu which lets you select and play newly installed HalfLife mods without first having to restart Steam in order for them to be listed in your Steam library Not only is this more convenient but time spent playing mods that are selected via this menu will also count toward your total hours played for HalfLife and keep all of your HalfLife screenshots in one place Cool right HalfLife released in November of 1998 is no doubt one of the most influential firstperson shooters of all time and Im no doubt the billionth person to tell you that HalfLife runs on the Gold Source engine which is a fork of id Softwares Quake 1 idtech 2 engine HalfLifes engine is a big part of what makes it so good in my opinion In large part because the movement just feels fantastic Unlike in HalfLife 2 which also has great movement though the Shift key doesnt make you sprint but walk Sprintrun is always on by default you never tire and you move at a rather brisk pace You move about as quickly as you do in other firstperson shooters of the mid to late 90s but dont let that fool you into thinking that HalfLife plays like a trve oldskool FPS What Im saying is not that HalfLife isnt oldschool but that its release marked a shift in the way that firstperson shooters would come to be developed for better or for worse HalfLife plays very differently in many ways to the firstperson shooters that preceeded it While there is no 2 3 or even 4weapon carrylimit as you often see in many modern firstperson shooters and you can carry all of the games weapons on your person at the same time and as already mentioned movement is rather fast etc etc you are however dealing with combat that is very coverfocused as the games most threatening foes rely heavily on hitscanning attacks There is nothing inherently unoldschool about hitscanning enemies its just that they make up the majority of HalfLifes tougher combat encounters and youre never really going to be circlestrafing and dodging incoming projectiles like you would expect to do in firstperson shooters preceeding HalfLife that are also touted as oldschool FPS classics Uuhhh you will be dodging smg nades though or at least be trying to trust me HalfLife also doesnt have secrets in the oldschool FPS sense and the games maps arent all disparate or somewhat disparate levels but flow together more seamlessly into large chapters with a pacing that is more varied than what youd see in many other firstperson shooters from this era HalfLife is not oldschool in the same sense that for example Doom or Quake are Uhm I guess Blood kind of did the wholeANYWAY while HalfLife was by no means the first FPS to include NPCs or scripted set pieces it is arguably the FPS most responsible for leading the genre in a more scripted linear and storyfocused direction which in the HalfLife series case culminated with HalfLife 2 Episode 2 in 2007 This is one of the main ways in which HalfLife would go on to influence the genre which Im not saying is all a bad thing who knows if we would have had Bioshock if it werent for HalfLife What I know for certain is that HalfLifes got mods Ah the mods There is no shortage of fantastic HalfLife mods Ive heard that there was a little mod that could called CounterStrike which went on to become one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time More on the movement Letting go of the forward key and holding down either the right or left directional key while smoothly moving your mouse in the same direction will allow you to curve your forward midair trajectory either left or right this is called air strafing You may freely alternate between left and righthand air strafes but this can be a little tricky at first Interestingly air strafing also increases your forward momentum and you can garner immense speed by chaining together welltimed jumps and air strafes bunny hopping Air strafing is a movement quirk carried over from Quakes adorable and quirky game engine where it works differently in several ways but the main gist of it is the same there as it is in HalfLife hold directional key move mouse in the same direction gaming bliss ensues This movement goodness was subsequently carried over into the Source Engine and tons of other games While the ways in which different games with air strafing handle momentum acceleration varies the aforementioned main gist of it all remains intact til this day and can even be seen in more recent games like Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends The bhop KZ climb and surf movement communities were born out of HalfLife and GoldSrc idtech 2 laid the groundwork for these things and with GoldSrc and HalfLife they came to fruition thanks to passionate communities Shoutout to Momentum Mod Theres A LOT more to HalfLifes movement than that but I have to stop myself before I write an entire speedrunning tutorial or I go off about how amazing Team Fortress 2s rocket jumping mechanics are Basically movement in HalfLifes engine and its derivative Source is tight deep and satisfying Like your mum I may be sooomewhat biased by the fact that HalfLife is literally one of the first games I ever played and nostalgia is crack cocaine even if my only experience with HalfLife in my diaperwearing years was with HalfLife Uplink which is effectively the games demo sort of and also well worth playing by the way but to me HalfLife oozes charm Its a cozy game The believable but blocky enviroments the heavily exaggerated reverberation effects the ARGH NO STOP of the scientists the kapow of the shotgun it all makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside In HalfLife you play as 27year old theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman who works at the Black Mesa Research Facility located somewhere in the New Mexico desert The game opens with you arriving late for work in the now very iconic tram ride intro sequence as Kelly Baileys fantastically ominous ambient music plays in the background As you breathe the air and take in the games atmosphere laden with hitech industrial theming it becomes abundantly clear that the goingson at Black Mesa must be of unfathomable magnitude and utmost importance The intro sets the tone for the game INCREDIBLY well I cannot say enough positive things about this intro Its a little long yes but its communicative and just wow When you start the game from the moment the games title on a black background fades away and allows you to see and until the games end you experience the game world entirely through the eyes of Gordon Freeman From the moment the proverbial and literal ride begins youre there every step of the way with Gordon through thick and thin through the scorching desert through once sterile offices where now lie the decaying corpses of your former colleagues through test labs home to questionable ethics its all unraveled to the player from Gordons perspective and its so damn compelling",

        "review": "The original HalfLife is an FPS masterpiece which kickstarted a narrative and mechanical revolution thats still ongoing in the genre to this day Because of its understated minimalist plot using environmental and gameplaybased storytelling its aged incredibly well and still makes for a very engaging experience The gameplay is every bit as excellent and solid as it was all those years ago the sound design is still phenomenal and the stylizedyetrealistic art direction makes for a look that still holds up today Buying it also gives you access to a huge huge quantity of great quality mods developed for the game over the course of almost 20 years and thats definitely worth the price of admission But looking beyond its legacy in modding and the standard also set by later entries in the series HalfLife is still a remarkable game and an absolute musthave",

considering its my favorite game of all time Please note it and reward it if you considered it pleasant to read Thanks bGood morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit Systemb HalfLife Just the mere mention of its name is enough to give you chills Many consider it the greatest FPS of all time Valves founding FPS is such a masterpiece that we still feel its aura today Named Game of the Year by more than 50 magazines it is a cult title It even made the terms DoomLike and QuakeLike obsolete Without forgetting that this is the beginning of Valves success story Is it even possible to do a purely objective review for HalfLife bTheyre waiting for you Gordon In the test chamberb Gordon Freeman is a scientist with a degree in theoretical physics from MIT specializing in the research of Anomalous Materials He is employed at the prestigious Black Mesa scientific complex Freeman is is entrusted with an experiment of capital importance the analysis of a crystal of alien origin Unfortunately contact of the sample with the antimass spectrometer has Unforeseen Consequences This leads to a Resonance Cascade of phenomenal power partially destroying the research center Worse still it opened an interdimensional breach through which warlike aliens emerge The army was called to the rescue but was ordered to kill all the witnesses Gordon must then fight his way to save his colleagues and escape this hell bYou arent scared are youb One of the great strengths of HalfLife is its storytelling You play as Gordon Freeman and see everything through his eyes No cutscene or dialogue intersperses the scientists adventures Everything is done so that you identify as best as possible with the character a hero in spite of himself bRun Think Shoot Liveb HalfLife is the ultimate evolution of the 90s FPS Its no longer just a question of taking down enemies Puzzles push you to interact with the world to progress use levers valves push or pull crates etc There are even vehicle sequences with a tram On a Rail The gunfights are breathtaking the AI is very clever bOh my Godwere doomedb Black Mesa is invaded by all kinds of creatures from Xen The soldiers shoots on sight at everything that moves the aliens as well as the employees of the Research Center The HalfLife bestiary is rich and varied each of the NPCs or creatures allies and enemies alike has its own behavior and animations The scientists and the security guards are your friends and colleagues they only want the best for you In addition to giving you advices they open certain locked doors The scientists can heal you if youre wounded and the Barneys can easily kill aliens like Headcrabs or Vortigaunts The Xen creatures are very different from each other but they all have one thing in common Theyre after you Here is the list of all these alien monsters Headcrabs Zombies Vortigaunts Houndeyes Barnacles Bullsquid Tentacles Gargantuas Ichthyosaurs Alien Grunts Alien Controllers The HECU has been dispatched to the Research Center to stem the alien invasion and do everything to prevent the Black Mesa disaster from becoming known These soldiers are battlehardened intelligent and brutal They have among other things machine guns heavy cannons automatic turrets Apache Osprey Helicopters F16 fighter jets Abrams Bradley Armored Tanks Black Ops Assassins are special enemies they are the only women we fight An Assassin is as agile as a Kunoichi dressed all in black They are as fast as lightning and can perform spectacular jumps Theyre equipped with a silent Glock and a huge and magnificent pair of grenades attached to the belt bWelcome to the HEV Mark IV protective system for use in hazardous environment conditionsb The HEV Mark IV protective system is the orange suit worn by Gordon Freeman It is the main equipment of the series it bears the symbol Gordon Freeman resists radioactivity burns electricity and chemicals thanks to it It absorbs a large part of the damage received and can be recharged using HEV chargers or batteries The Long Jump Module allows Gordon to make great leaps forward which proves very useful later bGordon doesnt need to hear all this Hes a highly trained professionalb Despite his appearance as a simple scientist Gordon Freeman handles weapons to perfection thanks to the time he spent in the Hazard Course The weapons are very numerous and varied classic or experimental and even a few of alien origin Heres the full list of weapons Crowbar Pistol Shotgun SMG or AR Revolver Crossbow Rocket Launcher Grenade Tripmine C4 Snark Hivehand Gauss Gun Gluon Gun bThose new suits can be tricky Please proceed to the next areab Hazard Course is Black Mesas training space for HEV suit users This is the one and only tutorial present in HalfLife made to familiarize yourself with the games mechanics bHey did you hear somethingb The music and sounds in HalfLife are of high quality They were composed by Kelly Bailey Each important moment in the game has its own music sometimes gloomy sometimes epic Hazardous Environments the Valve Theme which gives you chills during the fight on the edge of the cliff in Surface Tension All human characters are voiced and each monster has its own sounds Its easy to know which enemy to face next without even seeing it Every sound accentuate the science fiction touch and the players immersion The voice of the HEV Suit gives valuable information on the environment health status or quantity of ammunition bYou sure were going the right wayb The graphics of HalfLife are sumptuous for its time thanks to the GoldSrc engine The game became more beautiful and detailed when it was rereleased on Steam The settings are particularly immersive and varied bDidnt want to die alone anywayb In addition to its extraordinary singleplayer campaign HalfLife has a classic multiplayer deathmatch mode The fights are fun dynamic and brutal thanks to the large quantity weapons available to players In addition to that theres a plethoric choice of 18 maps and theyre different enough to renew the gaming experience bCatch me later Ill buy you a beerb 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of HalfLife which Valve celebrated with a contentrich update First of all the main menu of the game has been replaced by that of the WON version it is the original menu from 1998 The original Valve intro is also restored It finally brings HalfLife Uplink to Steam which weve been waiting for so long HalfLife Uplink is a unique HalfLife demo released in early 1999 This level never appeared in the original game it was a standalone only Four new multiplayer maps are added and three from the HalfLife Further Data additional content CD Four new multiplayer skins are added including Ivan The Space Biker and ProtoBarney from the 1997 Alpha Version bAnother important species revealed in actionb In addition to being an exceptional game HalfLife gave birth to a large number of cult multiplayer FPS franchises Day of Defeat Team Fortress and CounterStrike bI predicted all of this you know All of itb HalfLife is a remarkably effective FPS How can we not praise such a masterpiece This video game monument is timeless There is clearly a before and after HalfLife Every gamer must own it",

        "review": "Half lifeThe game that started it allEven though it was made back in 1998it is still a gemI dont vote games by their graphicsbut by their gameplayThis was an immersingwonderful and addicting experience for meI lived another lifeIn this gameThe game has everything a gamer asks for Immersing GameplayIndulging storyA Nice Selection of Weaponsand graphics that were thrilling in the year it was madebut are all old nowEven now this title holds up till todayshining its glory as the first game that Valve ever madeand a game that changed Gaming itselfNow I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game WARNING A little bit of spoiling ahead Gameplay ExcellentEither you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just dont seem to put you in peaceThere were a few places where it did get a little bit boringbut that was because I couldnt wait until I would experience something newThe terrain in the game is nicely madeeven though it is pretty old due to the date it was madeThe places you travel through are pretty differentyou wont be bored of seeing the same old place over and over againThe game itself is nicely balancedexcept that they could have put less ammo in the gameso you wouldnt always have a gun loaded 910 Story A nice story is told throughout the gameand that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the gameEven though it doesnt have any cutscenesit tells its story just wonderfullyIt keeps you in first person mode all of the timeso it makes you live the character all the way through the storyAll the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logicalas if could happen in real lifeThe characters are well done as wellfor they act as normal people would actThey are as they should bethey speakfighthelp you and do other stuffAnd there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the gamebut I will let you figure that out for yourselfThere arent the same scientists all over and over againbut we cant say this with security guardsThe enemies are widely assorted and wont make you think that they are dumbbut play as they are real and trying to get youNo dull moment will get you in this gameso dont be afraid of experiencing any in this game 1010 Weapons There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this gamebut do not expect too muchThere are the main weapons you would except from a game like thisand maybe a little bit more due to an Monster Invasion going on all around youThe game has its own signature weapon A CrowbarBut that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this gameWhile you progress through the game you will find weaponsbut there arent manyso every weapon you getyou make use ofbecause all of them are uniqueAs I wont spoil much hereI will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcherand a few of alien techologies are found in the game as wellYou will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weaponbecause it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weaponsand the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhereWhen you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gunmeaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot itand you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as wellBut when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce backbut if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spotdepending on which way you movedEven if you dont have any ammoyou get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammoEven though it recharges over timeit doesnt take much of it and it has special abilities 8510 Enemies From the headcrab even to the final bossthe enemies are nicely balancedYou are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tacticsso you know what to use on it and what to doYou probably wont find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you arent well armedOnce you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat themjust keep a look out for themor otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickleI wouldnt say that the enemies are hardYou can use the terrain to your advantage as wellLuckilyone group of your enemies is fighting anotherso you can use that to your advantage as wellif you find the right momentwinkBut I wouldnt rely on such stuffI would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of motherfuckersThere are a few weapons which have unlimited ammoand I feel that is unbalancedDont go prancing around as a pony as wellyou will get your ass kickedThere are flying enemiescrawling enemieswalking enemies and big enemiesThe crawling ones are easyjust keep a look out for them so they dont get the jump on youThe Flying ones need the right weaponslike a zoom in crossbowfor they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly awayThe walking ones are easy enoughjust keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OKBut the big ones need a plana strategy and a assault of weapons 9510 Graphics From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doomthis game is amazingIt now has its own HD modelsso a few things look better when the models are turned ONAny computer will be able to get this game runningso why not jump in it alreadyAnd as this game was made in 1998dont expect modern graphicsBut that couldnt stop you from playing this gamecould itThe terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as wellbut if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is todayAnd the graphics arent that badeverything is quite understandableThey have made the graphics the best way they couldand I dont blame them because I dont vote a game by its graphicsAnd if you cant stand the graphics there is a Source version of the gamemade by Valve as wellThere is a version made by fans as wellbut I wouldnt recommend that because it is modified a bitBut the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half lifeand the best out thereOf coursethat is if you look past the graphicsThere are even little details specified in the originl gamebut they wont be seen so good and will be kind of blurredBut be sure to keep your eyes litfor there are many leversbuttons and things like that throughout the gamethat blend in with the enviroment 8510 Overall look Even though this game is datedit is definently not deadBe sure to pick this game up on a saleor even buy it at its full pricebecause this game is worth every cent you pay for itI loved the gameit really got me pulled in and the story was just stunningI loved every place I came upon to in this gameseeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknownThis game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very endingThis is a great classic and everyone should play itit is an experience not to be missedIt changed gaming as it is nowand was a hit in gaming and it still isA wonderful game FINAL SCORE 910 Reviewed by Ultrix",

        "review": "61 hrs on record Dont trust that its clearly wrong haha Halflife is what started it for me Yeah sure I could say Doom is what started PC gaming for me and of course you cant forget Quake Wolfenstein Redneck rampage etc but HalfLife is what locked me firmly in place I still think of the times back then when I used to wake up at 6am on a Saturday to play some HalfLife and Starcraft and watch Pokemon That feeling is something that I cant replicate today Perhaps its nostalgia but that carefree feeling of being a kid and enjoying such an insane game is one of my fondest memories of growing up Not only was the single player insane to my ten year old mind back then but the countless mods that spawned because of this game and the fun times I had Some that immediately come to mind Pirates Vikings and Knights Vampire Slayer Battlegrounds The Specialists Brainbread The list is long and goes on and on Yeah yeah dont worry I didnt forget about CS Thats reserved for its own review I still have floppy disks filled with updates skin packs and bots that I downloaded from csnation Any of you remember countercrap RzE Rizzuh Lungfish The infamous myg0t cheating clan thatd youd occasionally run into P I recently cycled through some of the older games like Deathmatch Classic Team Fortress and Day of Defeat I was pleasantly surprised to see people still playing them It just goes to show you that HalfLife and any of its mods will continue to stand the test of time Lord Gaben I am who I am today because of you I wish you good health and a long life Thank you",

       "So after the overwhelming hype I decided to give Undertale a try, and I have to say I didn't really enjoy it. I see the appeal of it and understand why some people like it but it's just not for me. If I'm being brutally honest, this games feels like its being aimed at highschool-aged kids who think it's so funny to be \"random\" and love memes. I'm not trying to be highbrow but the humor absolutely did not click with me. Aside from a chuckle or two, I found most of the humor pretty grating and swinging at low-hanging fruit. Because I didn't really like the writing, I found the characters to be much less endearing than many others.\n",

The problem is that experience did not pay off in the end.  I'm able to tolerate cliff hangers of all kinds (I have read all of George RR Martin's books without having  multiple strokes).  But, this game, as beautiful as the visuals were, took little advantage of the possibilities the story had and completely fell flat at the end.  I literally sighed and thought \"surely there is more\" even as the credits rolled.\n",

       "Considering the raging fire at the end, and the \"tying up\" of the father/son story bit, the ending took little to no advantage of these circumstances.  There were so many great climactic possibilities there but instead...they just ended it with a sort of \"Well, that's life\" message.  No kidding, I'm fully aware that life can suck, hence the use of video games like this to escape it.\n",

       "It's really ashame that so many are hailing this as \"deep\" and \"insightful\" when in reality, if this were the narrative of any novel in a bookstore, it wouldn't sell 1000 copies.  The story was building and building and building, only to end with no payoff.\n",
       "\n",
       "Visually, it's stunning, and I kept thinking how great it would be to have an open world, multiplayer game in such a beautifully crafted world.  The light shafts through the trees, the color schemes and contrasts were amazing.  In fact, the visuals are about the only reason I don't feel completely cheated with this purchase.\n",

       "What story purpose did the camera serve?  Why did I board up the windows after the break-in?  Why did I explore the child's fort?  Why collect any of the notes and letters?

Theres no running past enemies most of the time so better do the whole 20 min area again. Wanna retry a jumping challenge? 5-10 min backtracking. Go to the Bank? 5 min. Oh, and don't forget farming. Never seen a game treating the players time with such disrespect. \n",
       "\n",
       "- The way the game is designed you have a strange difficulty curve. It starts of perfectly fine and turns quite hard one third trough. After that it only gets easier. I even killed the last 5 bosses by facetanking them. The last endgame content is difficult again. Those mid game weapon upgrades are way too overpowered. Such open worlds need some sort of scaling or weaker upgrades. Otherwise some content has to get too easy near the end. But never dying removed the backtracking which made the game extremly enjoyable.\n",

       "Honestly, all negative points could be forgiven if it wasn´t for the insane amount of backtracking. Imagine having to stare at a blank wall for 20 minutes after every fight in street fighter. That`s what this game feels like. If you don`t mind that at all, go ahead and buy it. It`s a really good game otherwise.\n",

Some parts of the game are just unfair which is bad game design but i don`t mind it that much. I`ve spend most of my time playing with mindless boring running. No challenge, no skill, just mundane and stale running. Originally this was done mostly in old games as a way to strech game time.

       "\n",
       "Bad instructions for beginners is Terrarias worst flaw. Its pretty hard to get into when your new. Having a friend showing you the basics helps. The Guide NPC helps but is fairly mediorce. You might have to  spend a lot of time looking at wikis to figure out what to do. Some people may like it since you get to explore and this might instead be a huge postive, so understand what you yourself prefer. I'd recomend watching a few youtube videos just to understand the basics. However once you get past the initial hump it picks up and gets better. Its mostly the first 2-3 hours that have a way to steep learning curve. The rest of the game is fairly decent and new things tend to become more fun.\n",

       "It also has alot of useful items only obtainable through RNG. Some may argue this makes it fun and it may for some but not for all, keep this in mind.\n",

       "One slighly more minor thing is that somtimes. Your world or characters may get corrupted. This usually never happens but if it does there is no way to recover them. However this rarely happens. I have only gotten a character lost once without mods. Seems like some people have this with in relations to terrarias cloud save function.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing if you do get the game. DONT GET ITEMS FROM OTHER PEOPLE. It does severly ruins the game. If you play multiplayer, make sure you either play with another new player. Or somone who is willing to start over. This game is about the journey not the destination. \n",

If you want to play on your pc, download the android apk and play from there unless you REALLY want the hats. The pets though, cost money on all versions and all FUTURE cosmetics will cost money on the steam version too, so you're not getting that much of a deal.\n",

       "The game also has very slow response to bugs and some issues remain in the game for ages!\n",

       "The Kill animation for the neck snap shows the wrong colour every time\n",
       "And worst of all  keyboard controls have a direct advantage over mobile controls due to the fact that after a meeting you can instantly call a new one by spamming the e and left click button, which actually significantly changes the balance of the game and makes it much harder for impostor to win while also giving players on pc a direct advantage. \n",
       "I don't recommend paying for this game at it's current state.\n",
       "Also, it should be mentioned that future major content (maps) will be exclusively paid dlc, and while I understand bills must be paid, it does mean the major content that will be added is going to restrict players from playing together and also split the playerbase. That's important to note.\n",
       "Speaking of servers, they're extremely bad. Very slow, most of them time the ping is entirely random, and players are not shown games from their region exclusively so you'll be playing with lots of players who don't speak your language. It's not a fantastic system and it ruins a lot of games. It's not to say that I don't like playing with foreigners of course but the language barrier it creates is incredibly difficult to play with.\n",

       "\n",
       "Con 1: The game is really a compilation of boss battles. Each boss battle is unique and cool. However a lot of the times bosses will have seemingly random moves that make no sense. Moves that you would only know about through trial and error. If you want to get the best score, you can't take damage at all which makes the game very grueling at times as you constantly open menu and restart because a random shark jumped behind you and took up half the screen instantly.\n",

       "Con 3 : I feel like the game would be funner for everyone if the first few levels were easier. I'm not saying they aren't relatively easy, but to a new player it can be a frustrating experience and if it were easier it would make the transition a lot smoother. Something we can all learn from Super Meat Boy is that if you make a game that relies on being challenging, then you need to start the player off slowly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Con 4: Building on what I mentioned before, Cuphead relies on being challenging because the game itself is not very long. If you don't worry about stats or getting perfect score the game can be completed in no time. This means it is really only made for the type of player that always tries to beat their own score, which is not everyone.\n",

       "Con 5: Hitboxes and determining what object will hurt you and what won't can be really confusing. Usually you can tell because the game consists of the background, platform, obstacles that don't hurt you, and everything else that does hurt you. This is similar to my first Con that this creates a sort of artificial difficulty and encourages trial and error. However this is more due to the nature of the game's art style and outlining, which is usually consistent and not a problem.\n",

It feels like some of the worst parts of the original Dark Souls where runbacks, or even backtracks to explore other opportunities involve so much tedious hiking over terrain you've already cleared that it becomes disspiriting. Every boss fight or spike maze failure feels like it means 20 screens of sleepwalking with no real threat to get back to where you died. Heaven forbid you vaguely remember a path you might be able to tackle with a new power. Or remember a merchant squirreled away somewhere you finally have enough cash to shop at. You just have to route through half the world to get there. I sincerely hope you remembered those prices accurately.*\n",

That I was just slogging through this boring crap because I was pot-committed and that's what you're supposed to do in a Metroidvania.

       "As a side note, the charm system is an incredibly cool idea: X equipment slots, and Y charms that each take Z slots, each granting you different abilities... Unfortunately, those abilities end up usually being crap like \"Show yourself on the map\" or \"Auto-gather all the loot,\" so you can't even stack fun abilities because you're too busy filling those slots with the \"Make the game less of a pain in the ass\" near-mandatory options.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aesthetically, the game owes a lot to Dark Souls, including a completely unnecessary aping of the \"get your cash from your dead body\" mechanic which only serves to make runbacks both boring AND stressful. As such they substitute a lot of \"dead people acting sad\" for actual storytelling, but they still manage to be above the average Souls yarn. It is possible the game was meant to not give you a reliable map and ask you to travel by memory, like Dark Souls 1 did. But I can't see it. The game's levels twist and wind back in and around themselves, and very few rooms have any real personality beyond their tileset (And the tilesets are no slouch, mind you...).

No, you don't. Once you buy your first jokers/planet card (those upgrade specific hands) you will effectively be locked into that particular hand for the rest of the run. If you want to go for any consistency, the entire way through you will play pairs, two pairs, and high cards, maybe a flush if you feel fancy. There are no other hands you can realistically expect to repeat in a standard deck. Making pairs out of playing cards is not very fun and you can buy a deck of cards much cheaper if you want to do that instead. It is less bad on low difficulties, but if you care about optimal play you are doomed anyway.\r\n",
       "- \"So if the battle has zero decisions/thinking involved, maybe at least the shop does?\" Not really, If you decided that your life belongs to the High Card Jail, you buy whatever jokers support that playstyle, and it's not hard to figure out. There are jokers that give you consistent results and you buy them. Planet cards require no thought. Exception are tarot cards, especially the ones you can play during a fight. Those allow for deck interaction, and there's a limited number of situations where you have to think before you clik a button, however:\r\n",

All of these things remove already small amount of decisions that you have in this game. Less discards? I guess you play High Cards and Pairs, hope you have fun. Less gold? You probably can't afford to buy those fun tarot cards, because all your money is to be spent on the jokers that give you more power. It turns the game into a restart fiesta, where you go into the first shop or two, and then press restart because you didn't get any of the things that make you win the game, and if you win the joker gamble you reward is playing high card for the next 20 minutes or so, yaay.\r\n",

       "-whereas Chapters 1-8 introduced a collection of unique objects that interact with the basic mechanics (which makes them a lot easier to pick up and learn), Chapter 9 forces you to learn an 'advanced' technique that has a timing window so narrow and arbitrary that it frequently feels like a coinflip as to whether it will even work or not.\n",
       "-whereas Chapters 1-8 were tightly constructed and never outstayed their welcome, Chapter 9 is nearly 4 times as long as the chapter specifically designed to be an endurance test (it's 40 minutes start to finish...  Assuming you never die.  Which for the vast majority of people is physically impossible).\n",

       "I am writing this review because IT WAS NOT WORTH IT.  I had long since lost any sense of positive feeling towards this game, and was only pushing forward out of the sense that it would feel worse to leave it undone than it would be to continue suffering for however long it took.\n",

       "For one thing, I'm a bit of a completionist; I dislike not finishing games, even though I tend to have my attention wander.\n",
       "But, more importantly - and this is the thing that for me ultimately ruins Celeste for me - the first 8 chapters are built explicitly to make you feel like you can do it - like the challenge is not only surmountable, but that you might actually have fun doing it.  The game makes you WANT to finish it before it clamps a car battery to your nipples for 20+ hours for having the tamarity to play the chapter reserved for the Speedrunners.\n",
       "\n",
       "EDIT: Since apparently I need to further clarify, the third objection:\n",
       "\"But it's extra content!\"\n",

       "2) At this point it's only distinguishing feature from the regular content is that it's presented as post-game (and is terrible).\n",

       "The concept of dodging enemy bullets during their attacks is a relatively novel concept, but controlling your heart with keyboard is somewhat undesirable, and no matter which game-play style you take, it becomes stale relatively fast when you encounter the same enemy 5 or more times. [i]Yes, an integral part of the game-play is incredibly amazing when I come to dread having the repeat the same actions for each specific enemy, with absolutely no variation aside from the use of a whopping 2 attacks, most of which being carbon copies of each other or time-wasters. But who needs game-play when the plot is so stellar, huh?[/i] \n",
       "The writing, aside from the terrible puns (which made me chuckle slightly), is forgettable; yet everyone and their mother praises it. It is [b]not clever writing, for instance when the game acts as if you know what's going on for trying to dodge what are obviously bullets while in a tiny, cramped box.[/b] \n",
       "The \"puzzles\" are either insultingly easy or lack any explanation but just end up being trial-and-error; all of them come off as time-wasters, and tie into the supposed narrative only because the game attaches them to a character who offers a weak, idiotic excuse for the puzzle existing in the first place. \n",
       "The fanbase is fucking awful, yet I let myself be deluded for once, just once, that I would finally happily be wrong about my first impressions of a game that every indie gamer and others have endlessly sucked off as if it's the CITIZEN KANE OF VIDEO GAMES. Also the creator comes off as a massive twat, bragging about how he adds certain sections of negative reviews to a collection of things to ignore.\n",
       "Despite my lack of enjoyment for the game, I'd suggest for you to try the demo and make up your own mind, rather than let a whiny little cunt like me influence you; after all, apparently I'm in the minority when it comes to my dislike for the game. An acquaintance even implied that I must hate FUN, which is obviously true; I obviously just play video games still to distract my eyes with the purdy grafix. So instead of listening to my bitching, go buy the indie gaming world's Citizen Kane, and go in expecting the most perfect game in the history of the universe, because [i]obviously I just hate being happy and enjoying anything.[/i][/spoiler]\n",

       "I first heard about Vampire Survivors from a friend who had some very interesting allegations about the game. I listened to those brief complaints and thought nothing more for sometime after. Then another friend played it and talked about it. Then I found out the game had 40,000 reviews at 99% positive. It's one of the top-rated games on Steam right now, with it currently totaling 60,000 at 98% positive. To put it short, my interest was piqued. I wanted to see what the buzz was all about. I also ended up looking over those allegations with a third friend for additional verification. And I found some interesting stuff.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's stick to the game's content for a brief bit before getting to the real meat of the discussion. Vampire Survivors is a 2D rogue-lite focused on killing monsters and surviving. The store page describes the gameplay as \"minimalistic\" and I couldn't agree more. Every attack is automated, the only player input is walking around and choosing one of three items every time you level up. It's pretty barebones, especially when the numerous enemy types all feel the same. The empty and procedurally generated boring mass of land the first level offers doesn't help either. Nor the straight line of nothing that the library offers. The default walk speed is a snail’s pace, so it’s not even like circling the enemies a hundred times over is fast-paced either. The constant stops in gameplay are the final nail in the coffin for me. Leveling up as a new player makes you stop and read every minute, which brings the pacing to a complete stop. But don't even get me started on the item chests. Opening a chest freezes the game and forces you to watch an animation that varies in length from 10 to 20 seconds. Doesn't sound like much but after seeing it a dozen times from my very short play session, it quickly became an annoyance. It's a game that plays itself and some people are after just turning their brain off every now and then. But I don't even understand that appeal because of those constant stops. The hour I played felt like it lasted twice as long because of how slow-paced it all felt. I've played free flash games with about as much engagement as this. Playing the game quickly became a chore to check off if what I heard about the game was true. While I may have found the game boring, it wouldn't have gotten my attention if that was it.\n",
       "\n",
       "But that wasn't it. I first heard about the game because of some allegations of stolen artwork with the sprite art. Now these are very serious allegations that I didn't wanna just throw around. So I had to get digging and with a friend's help, we found some interesting stuff. To start the sprite work wasn't made by the developer. It was purchased as a Patreon bundle through Oryx Design Lab, with the sprites originally being made for a Castlevania fan game. These sprites are a combination of minor edits, recolors, and straight rips of art found throughout numerous Castlevania games. A few examples are provided below. With the items, the bottom one is the original sprite with the Vampire Survivors version being on top. And with the enemies, the right version is the Vampire Survivors version. But you shouldn't need clarification, since they are so vastly different after all! Additionally, the cover art features two near-complete traces of cover art from Bayonetta and Castlevania. The Bayonetta one is particularly egregious since everything waist up is traced. The Vampire Survivors lady even looks weird when you see her hands without the magic blocking them since it looks like she's holding a gun. I kind of have to wonder why the art was traced because after looking through other works of the artist responsible, it seems like this is a one-time scenario. I am more than welcome to be proven wrong with any of my provided examples. In fact, if any mistakes were made, please point them out.\n",
       "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782328525\n",
       "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782329907\n",
       "Now what interests me, even more, is the response I've seen to these allegations from both the community and the developer. According to a resetera post from the developer, the art isn't stolen because he bought it from someone. As buying art that someone else stole magically washes away the fact that it was stolen. The developer has been pretty well aware that the sprite work is similar beyond a reasonable doubt for quite a while now and has continued to use assets from that pack. As a side note, I'm never committing time to research on that hellsite again. But oh my god the braindead takes I've seen from people defending the stolen art has fueled me with the energy needed to go to wastes of code like that site. From comments on the tracing saying \"You can't own a pose\" to saying the blatant art theft is just an \"inspiration\".\n",
       "\n",
       "And look originality is hard when hundreds of thousands of ideas have been executed. Characters like Dracula and the Grim Reaper have hundreds of incarnations throughout media and art, but that doesn't mean one Grim Reaper is ripping another off purely by sharing names. But that’s a different case when both Grim Reapers are orange and have the exact same silhouette. Undertale is inspired by Earthbound, A Hat in Time is inspired by Mario 64, and Lethal League took inspiration from Jet Set Radio. Claiming that any of these games ripped off another just because they have similar art direction or gameplay is incredibly dishonest. But when the only differences in your visuals are one has a different coat of paint and is slightly thinner, you start exiting the territory of \"inspired\" and entering the realm of plagiarism. Besides, it’s not like the stolen art is even that good! Not saying that would excuse the blatant art theft, but it would at least mean the game looks nicer! And while you can’t own a pose, you can own art. The ostrich-like behavior I've seen from people looking at carbon-copied artwork has been baffling. Sticking your head in the ground over a problem just because you like it is not only obnoxious but ruins the industry.\n",
       "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2782330371\n",
       "As for a bunch of miscellaneous stuff to wrap up the review: The soundtrack is incredibly repetitive and if I was ever forced to play the game again, I’m turning it off. The game expects you to grind for hours on end to unlock everything for incredibly interesting rewards. Sarcasm aside, I’m not spending 40 hours to deal 5% more damage or walk slightly faster. Unlocks as a whole kinda suffer because everything is automated. The weapons I enjoyed the most were the knife and garlic just because I had some control over them. On a positive note, the game’s only worth $3??? It’s really hard to get any praise from me on the game to be completely honest. Maybe I’m just a regular hater of what’s popular, but I’m just not understanding the appeal of the game.\n",
       "\n",
       "But you know what's the best part of an early access game by an indie developer? Everything can be subject to change. I don't think I'll ever enjoy the gameplay, but that doesn't mean the artwork has to stay stolen. Like I said earlier the game exploded in popularity out of nowhere and that means more funds for the developer. Developers bringing back the support they've gotten to the community by improving their game isn't unheard of. Making actually original art by hiring an artist will not only make the game look way better, but it also won't be art theft anymore! Criticism is how games improve, I have hope that the developer continues to improve the game. [b]Currently, though, I have to give the game something around a 1/10.[/b] I'd rather spend my $3 on a good cup of coffee or bag of M&M's than a freeware game. And I am by no means wishing harassment of any kind towards the indie developer, as the stolen art is effectively the result of a con.</td>\n",

The negatives: If you are an older gamer like me, the writing is not as good as the hype would lead you to believe. While the bullet-hell mini game combat is different, it coupled with other design flaws makes it very difficult to play the completely non-lethal route your first time through unless you read a guide and know what to expect next. I won't get into details, but there is no way to get more hp without using lethal means. I personally found most of the writing adolescent at best, but to each their own. And finally puzzles are introduced in the beginning making me feel like they were going to be a major part of the game, but ended up being used not even a handful of times.\n",

If you don't mind having your money squeezed out by your fomo then this is a fun game. Otherwise just erase it from your mind and you won't have to worry about missing out on anything.</td>\n",

Unfortunately, my experience has been a bit different than most  and comes down to the decision of Innersloth to age gate Free Chat and creating a Display Name. The friends I play with did not have the same barrier and I could not find any info online of my situation and everyone wrote it off as shady and scam-like, but after researching and scouring discords and sending emails, I've reached confirmation that Innersloth will require you to submit your credit card or SSN to be able to remove these restrictions, a truly needless and poorly implemented process that will do more harm than good. \n",

       "I hit \"not recommended\" because most of the recommended reviews do not mention any problems. I did enjoy this game, but I feel it has a flaw that seriously mitigates it in the long term. This game is a great time with friends and it is fun to progress, get loot, and furnish your ship. However, the game is set up where there is no ending, however the quota will keep rising until it is unachievable and you will die as a result. You can't even make save files, so once you are \"fired\" your whole campaign is gone. By the time the quota got too high to meet, my friends and I all agreed we wished we could continue buying new gadgets and progressing. So I'd say it either needs an ending other than death, or the quota should rise slower, and eventually plateau. (the plateau could be higher depending on a difficulty setting.) You should also be able to load back to previous saves.\n",

       "Everything seems watered down in this game. It seems like they want to pad the play time by locking the most unnecessary things behind grinding ingredients to put in the cauldron, and thus each increment of progress in the game is underwhelming and with barely any impact, thus it feels underwhelming and grindy. The boons are watered down and boring, I don't really feel the same dopamine rush as the first game when I get fresh boons to choose from. Partly because of the new mana mechanic. I understand wanting to expand the concept, and add some more depth and complexity. Sadly, the mana mechanic was a dud as it just slows everything down, and a lot of the boons are either mana related, or are tied to mana as a way to dial their power back. In the first game, there were a lot of straight-forward powerful boons that you could combine with a weapon and then build on, and you'd find these boons that weren't great at their surface but they complimented your main boon, so they became part of the build and fun. All boons in this game just feels like complimentary boons, but without a main boon to build around.\n",

Every time I see an exclamation mark above an NPC's head I roll my eyes because I have to listen to them drone on about stuff that is uninteresting/doesn't really matter. Except for the ghost roomate of course, when she has an exclamation mark above her head I just run past her, because I know whatever she will say will be so obnoxious, boring, unimportant while being tied to an annoying personality that I know I don't need to explore to see if it ever gets better. The NPC's and dialogue in the first game were actually interesting and you actually wanted to stop to listen to them. Except Medusa, I never felt she contributed to the story and her personality was annoying, but after playing H2 I've begun to miss her too.\n",

I didn't need that in the first game, and if I had, I obviously wouldn't regard it as highly, and wouldn't even have given this game a chance in the first place. And if you were as big a fan as me of the first game you probably will do the same, and this review won't dissuade you. Maybe you'll even manage to convince yourself you're having fun grinding materials to unlock your tarot cards, then other materials to actually be able to use them, then other materials to use the cauldron to unlock the ability to grind other materials to upgrade the tarot cards, etc.</td>\n",

       "\n",
       "Sure, plenty of trolls will tell you to git gud, and if you're willing to be patient enough the game is still beatable despite this, and overcoming some of the cheaper areas of the game gives you satisfaction for overcoming these flaws, but the frustration is simply not worth it. Being frustrated because of your own lack of skill is one thing, but to lose over and over because of a broken game just has no appeal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Probably the best example of this in the game is a battle you will face against a ghost who possesses a train. In the first phase of the battle, several bullets are thrown at you that you can shoot at and hopefully destroy before they hit you. However, these bullets have two problems. The first being that they have no set amount of hits to destroy them. Sometimes four hits will do it, and sometimes it might take as many as eight. If it happens to be the latter, then it's possible that the bullet has reached you and hit you for damage already, which is a huge disadvantage in the first seconds of a long battle. I found myself restarting bosses far more than being killed by said bosses simply because of the unlikelihood I could take on an entire battle with 2 hp (as well as my desire to achieve the higher grades in battles, which of course requires full health).\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, that alone isn't worth the flak I'm giving the game, of course. But the problems in this part alone get even worse. There was a particular glitch that would randomly take a bullet that you destroyed, and immediately respawn it just above your character so that it turns into an unblockable attack. There is just simply no defense against this, and no particular reason it happens, but it does. If the goal of a battle is to dodge the bullets, that's fine. That's a challenge. But if there is a system set in place to destroy the weapons coming at you, but it requires you to literally roll the dice and hope it means that the game doesn't decide to hit you regardless of your actions? Well, that's pretty broken.\n",
       "\n",
       "But, I mean... Git gud, right? Sure. Don't listen to internet trolls. There's hundreds upon thousands of games out there that are beautiful and not broken, and ultimately it's your money. If you want to throw down twenty bucks for an unfair amount of frustration and that makes you happy, then cool, this game is perfect. But if you want challenging, there's better options.

The characters are well written and relatable, the scenery looks nice and pretty, and the story starts off kinda nicely.

Wherever you go you're running into trees and rocks you can't cross, paths that go all over the place, and all of that only really serves to get the player lost and maybe extend the playtime a bit, making the player resort to pulling up the rather clunky map system every 10 steps. There's nothing much to see in this game aside from the trees and rivers, etc., and the game suffers from the gameplay consisting entirely of \"Go from Point A to Point B\". While this is a \"Walking Simulator\" as you might've heard, the game really relies on okay-scenery and occasional funny banter between the characters to keep you from falling asleep. \n",

       "The story also eventually devolves into a \"mystery\" kind of ordeal, which seems like a rather sharp turn from the tone of the game before. Not only does this \"mystery\" kind f come outta left field, it also lacks a satisfying conclusion, much ike the game itself. The ending is agreed upon by many to be rather disappointing, which some argue is on purpose, leaving the player empty and wanting more in some kind of artsy way. \n",
       "\n",
       "Another thing to take note of is the pricetag to playtime ratio here. There are games out there worth $10 that could keep you playing for dozens of hours. This game, however, falls a little short in that respect. It carries a heavy $20 pricetag despite the fact that players will not take more than 3-6 hours to finish this game, depending on how often and how badly they get lost. With different choices and options making really marginal difference, it causes this game to have EXTREMELY little replay value. In fact, the first minutes of the game are you making 'decisions' (as many are you just clicking from single dialogue option to progress), with the whole section having such little impact that it could've just as easily all been a textbox and the game is simply trying to fool you into thinking it's anything different. I can't in good conscience recommend a game of this price when it lacks so much in the entertainment value. \n",

The event later triggered as I walked deeper into the area after wandering around for 15 minutes.  I liked the rappelling part too but at some point it just kind of became annoying.

After playing it I had a mix feeling. I loved the concept, artwork  and the plot. Yet it was too simple, short and limited to really leave a proper impression. Usually I don't care much about dropping a positive or negative review on anything, as I think in the end it's all about an invidual taste, or expectation more than anything. And even if I dislike it I don't feel a need to write it down to critizise as I know what I look for, and what I would reccomend to friends or not. But to cut it to the truth, even tho' I agree that some words isn't really something we would have to accept in this society I know far to well how things can slip out. It doesn't always mean it's something well hidden behind it. In these modern times the biggest problem I see is how literal everyone takes things, even sarcasm and satire is no longer understood, and even if, it is still taken absolutely seriously and out of context just so some people can use it to further their need for attention or case. This is something I find hypocritical, and also against the right of free speech as I can say I am a strong advocate for. Thus I have to combine the reasently \"Pewdiepie-issue\" with my mediocre experience of this game and leave this here. It's just gone too far.</td>\n",

The end.\" This is pure analogy - I don't want to give out specific story spoilers in such a short game, so all I  can say is that if you go into a genre with expectations and don't receive them, it can feel jarring and disappointing. In the case of walking simulators like this, I do believe they should be considered more like a book or a movie, since there is essentially no gameplay.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now Firewatch isn't a spooky ghost story - but my point is, the most obvious, boring, dull things don't make it into books, movies, or games. I had expectations for the writing; and this wasn't delivered on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it's about the experience, the journey, the characters!\" you might say, and you would be absolutely right. Those are important things - but at the same time, the writers should be going somewhere and I felt like there was so much that this game could have delivered and it simply didn't. You shouldn't just be wasting peoples time and at the end say \"Well weird things don't happen to normal people, if you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.\" I don't invest my time into entertainment and media for the mundane. It is a demonstration of good writing to be able to hook people into a story and keep them gripped - but by the end this felt like half a game, like something was missing, as if development had ended too soon, and a DLC called \"The Real Ending\" would be announced (I wish!)[/spoiler]\n",
       "\n",
       "If you didn't want any suggestion of spoilers, I can sum it up by saying I was disappointed by the ending, and the general story of this game. In a walking simulator with little to no gameplay other than a progressive linear romp through admittedly beautiful visuals, the story and it's progression is critical. I loved the art, the setting and much of the dialogue. However, at £5/hour (3 hours to finish the game when developers discussed 5-6 hours so I'm not sure what happened there) I just didn't feel like this game offered value or quality entertainment for me and on that basis, I wouldn't recommend it.\n",
       "\n",
       "EMPHASIS -  I do not think this is a bad game - in fact, I think it is a very good dialogue driven first person adventure, with amazing graphics and a wonderful setting. But for me, that's just not enough to recommend it. In this type of game for me, the story is the most important aspect and in this regards I felt it fell short. If you are looking for an exploration game with good dialogue and witty characters then this may suit you perfectly but ultimately I was disappointed with the experience.</td>\n",

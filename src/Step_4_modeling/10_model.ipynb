      "        \"review\": \"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history It is in my opinion the best game to ever have a crosshair It is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in It starts off with a team trying to kill another team I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game I wanted to play every chance that i could On my road of cs adventures I encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it wasnt a lot of fun Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn I was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be Sure enough I was proven wrong We started off by practicing a little bit Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class I made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course When I play counterstrike the whole world disappears Only I the mouse and my teammates remain We are united in a common goal We strive collectively towards an end we all desire Each player has a spot to hold They stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory Thus CS celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence When I play CS I play until my veins pump battery acid and then I play some more CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny What destiny might you ask I spoke before of unity And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family That is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves Not that these small metal objects are actually animate Im of course speaking only metaphorically Over the course of the years I have increased in skill but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share Even if that team is less than ideal I have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability Instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the AK the AWP the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno And more importantly the teammates at my side I love them It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness In conclusion I love cs I love to win I love pushing myself to my physical limits Its that feeling that first drove me to the computer For every second that I am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside sitting at the television or playing sports I had an extraordinary time playing this game and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel This review may be over this game may be dead but I will never stop playing counerstrike 16\",\n",

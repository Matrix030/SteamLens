# Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

**Memory Errors**:
```bash
# Reduce batch size in configuration
# Edit HARDWARE_CONFIG in the script:
'gpu_batch_size': 32,  # Reduce from 96
'chunk_size': 200,     # Reduce from 400
```

**Dask Cluster Issues**:
```bash
# Reset cluster manually
# In Python console:
from dask.distributed import Client
client = Client()
client.restart()
```

### Performance Tuning

**For High-Memory Systems**:
```python
HARDWARE_CONFIG = {
    'worker_count': 8,
    'memory_per_worker': '4GB',

    'chunk_size': 500
}
```

**For Memory-Constrained Systems**:
```python
HARDWARE_CONFIG = {
    'worker_count': 2,
    'memory_per_worker': '2GB',
    'gpu_batch_size': 16,
    'chunk_size': 100
}
